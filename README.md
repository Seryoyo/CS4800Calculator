# CS4800Calculator
Calculator for the class CS4800, Calculator with interactive GUI with basic functions.

I will be programming this calculator with html,css,javascript.

My initial estimate for how many hours I believe this project will take is about 4 to 5 hours. I will make a compromise and say 4 hours and 30 minutes in total.
